If the programmer does not need to encrypt the code, then should have certain coding standards in their code. Implement coding standards to improve code readability. This is very useful when used with other programmers, because using coding standards, the code should not have any basic coding errors and look clean to others. This means you donâ€™t have to explain every line of code to other programmers. Most importantly, it is going to help you read your old code. It would be ridiculous if the programmer cannot read his old code. To prevent this, the best is to always implement coding standards. 

Another reason for using coding standards is to learn a language, because the standard is likely to be the basic standard of the language. If the coding standard issues warnings or errors, even the code can achieve the expected results, but it is still very likely to violate certain rules of the language or library. Only code standards can help programmers solve these basic problems. Basically coding standards will help programmers always have a common format of their code, and no bad coding habits. 

Programmers with experience in other coding standards such as checking styles should have a very similar feeling when using ESLint for the first time. A programmer should not complain or feel pain about fixing warnings and errors provided by coding standards, because it is part of the coding. If programmers are always irritated by coding standards, they should consider switching to another profession. Overall, programmers only need to get used to coding standards, implement and enforce standards. They will be thanked for their experience in using coding standards in the future.
