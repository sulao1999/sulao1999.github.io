Javascript is a very powerful programming language. As long as a programmer has experience based in Java, C, and other similar programming languages, then learning the basics of Javascript will be easy. On the way to learn the basics of Javascript, programmers may find it easier to code, and have a high probability. If it is only based on the basic experience of Javascript, it can be considered as an improved programming language of Java and C.

Different from Java or C programming language, Javascript will be more convenient to change the keyword, function, and object, thus shortening the coding time and making the whole code clearer. 
For example, In Java, every variable is assigned data type :
``` 
int x = 0; 
String str = new String(); //object
``` 
In Javascript, can use keyword let to declare a variable, object, array:
```
let x = 0;
let str = " ";
```
From a software engineering perspective, Javascript to make array, string, and object easier to access and use, it can conclude that Javascript is a good programming language. In addition, athletic software engineering may have similar views on Javascript and software engineering because team communication should be more convenient than other programming languages.

The practice WODs, which are to solve programming problems, is very useful for improving coding skills. It tests programmer knowledge about Javascript or the program language, and skills. There is a lot of stress to practice WOD with time limits, but when success solves the problem, it will bring a lot of joy and a sense of success. Programmers should enjoy the pressure from practice WOD, because even if the problem cannot be solved, it is still a good practice. In addition, compare the answer code with the solution to find improvements. For example, the function is written to solve the practice WODs, its time complexity is O(n<sup>2</sup>), while the time complexity of the solution code is O(n). Therefore, after comparing the code, the programmer should absorb knowledge from the solution to improve his/her code.
