  There are many important concepts in software engineering that are worth learning by programmers. Although some programmers may not need to use software engineering in their careers, the concepts in software engineering can be applied to other types of fields. Some concept example comes from software engineering, Development Environments, Agile Project Management, and Design Patterns. There are more important concepts in software engineering such as [Coding Standards](https://sulao1999.github.io/essays/use-coding-standards-to-get-future-self-thanks.html), [Open Source Software Development](https://github.com/open-source), and [Ethics in Software Engineering](https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics), etc. These concepts are very helpful to programmers' careers.

  Every programmer has different preferences for the development environment, general are called Integrated development environment (IDE). Integrated development environment usually come with a text code editor that helps developers easily write software code. It should some awesome features like syntax highlighting, automatic completion of specific programming languages, and check whether there are errors in the code being written (Could use [coding standards](https://sulao1999.github.io/essays/use-coding-standards-to-get-future-self-thanks.html) to check errors too). Some Integrated development include compiler, and debugger. If you want to try an integrated development environment, [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) will be a good choice.

Here is the syntax highlighting example in [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/):
