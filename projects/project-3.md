In this project, I am trying to use a game engine to develop a game from scratch. Although the game engine has many functions that help create a game, the project is very difficult. Using a game engine is very similar to writing a program. Creating scenes, dialogues, and characters, similar to writing functions and objects in programming languages, also the difficulty between developing a game and coding is very similar too. The difficulty of making a game is proportional to the size of the game because each element must be related to each other.

When I create this game, debugging the game is very important. Sometimes it is difficult to find errors just by looking at the code or game elements, so the only way to debug the game is to run them repeatedly and look for errors. Sometimes debugging and repairing takes more time than the creating scenes, and dialogues part. After the project is over, it is very important that I can debug effectively and correctly.
